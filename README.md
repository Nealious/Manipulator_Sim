# 3D Dynamic Robotic Arm Modeled in Matlab

This project is based on my experience from the course BMEG 425, I intend on building on this knowledge and code base to simulate a robotic manipulator with the ability to control the manipulator's end effector position using a simulated joystick, dynamic manipulability elipses and force control.
